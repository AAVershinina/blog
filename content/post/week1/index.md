## About me

- Hi! my name is Angelina and I am 18 years old. I am a first year university student. I love dance and art

## About last week

-I devoted the whole week to studying new disciplines: C++ programming, mathematical logic.

I also spent time in dance rehearsals as we prepare for the competition.

I started reading the book "Man's Search for Flush" by Victor Franklin. This book covers issues: the meaning of life and death, love and suffering, humanism and religion.
