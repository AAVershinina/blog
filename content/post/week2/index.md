- The whole past week has been devoted to dance rehearsals as we prepare for the competition.
- A little preview:
I have been dancing for 15 years in the Carousel Dance Ensemble. our team is developing in several directions (modern dances, folk, pop, hip-hop)
- Soon there will be an important competition in the city of Mozhaisk, where we will present our best numbers in several categories.
At the moment I devote a lot of time to rehearsing on stage, this band has become a second family for me
